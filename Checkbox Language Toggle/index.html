            <h2>President Kennedy - 1962</h2>
            <p>The path we have chosen for he present is full of hazards, as all paths are; but it is the one most
                consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitments around the world. The cost of
                freedom is always high, but Americans have always paid it. And one path we shall never choose, and that
                is the path of surrender or submission. Our goal is not the victory of might, but the vindication of
                right; not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom, here in this hemisphere, and, we
                hope, around the world. God willing, that goal will be achieved.</p>

            <h2>General Patton - 1944</h2>
            <p>I don't want to get any messages saying, 'I am holding my position.' We are not holding a goddamned
                thing. Let the Germans do that. We are advancing constantly and we are not interested in holding onto
                anything, except the enemy's balls. We are going to twist his balls and kick the living shit out of him
                all of the time. Our basic plan of operation is to advance and to keep on advancing regardless of
                whether we have to go over, under, or through the enemy.</p>
